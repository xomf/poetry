Artix Linux, oh how you shine,
A rolling release, always divine.
Your open source spirit, a pure delight,
Bringing joy to users, day and night.

Your system, free from systemd's hold,
Giving freedom, as its story's told.
A community driven, the perfect mold,
For users seeking, a system of gold.

Your packages, up to date, with care,
No bloat, just what's needed, is there.
Boot times fast, without a scare,
Stable and reliable, beyond compare.

Your philosophy, to keep it light,
Making it easy, to use, with might.
From desktops to servers, you take flight,
Artix Linux, a true delight.
